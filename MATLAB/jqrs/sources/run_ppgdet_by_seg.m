function QRS = run_ppgdet_by_seg(ecg,fs,window,thres,ecgType)
% this function is used to run the QRS detector for each window window (non overlapping)
% this is needed because in the case of big artefacts at the begining of
% the record (i.e. where the P&T threshold is computed) it can make the detection fail.
%
% inputs
%   ecg:        ecg signal
%   fs:         sampling frequency
%   window:     size of the window onto which to perform QRS detection (in seconds)
%   thres:      threshold to be used
%   ecgType:    'FECG' or 'MECG'
% 
% output
%   QRS:        QRS location in nb samples (ms)
