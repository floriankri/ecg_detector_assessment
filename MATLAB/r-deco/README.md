**R-DECO: An open-source Matlab based graphical user interface for the detection and correction of R-peaks**

**Repository Description**
1.  R_DECO.m: Opening code of the GUI
2.  Common: Folder that contains general codes which can also be used outside the GUI
3.  Examples: Folder that contains a Matlab and Excel example signal
4.  R_peak_detection: Folder that contains the main algorithm and GUI codes

**How To Open The GUI**

Type R_DECO in the Matlab command line and press enter. The opening code will ensure that the necessary folders are added to the path and initialize the GUI.
